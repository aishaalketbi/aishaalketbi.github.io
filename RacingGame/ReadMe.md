For my racing game workshop assignment, I wanted to create an engaging simulation that immerses the player into high-speed races on intricately designed tracks combining mountainous terrains and urban landscapes. The game incorporates AI, a dynamic speedometer, and a minimap, all of whuch elevate the player's experience by testing their driving skills and strategic thinking in different environments.

Initially, I had envisioned a straightforward racing game with simple track designs. However, this made the game too simple, which detracted from the immersive experience I aimed for. Thus, I decided to enrich the game by introducing more complex circuits and different car designs. I did go through several challanges such as building the roads on the mountainous terrains, adding HUD, and setting up waypoints for the AI to drive through. To counter this, I used several online tutorials to ensure I had a working game.

These are the resources I used:

Using these resources, I implemented features that significantly improved gameplay sych as:
- AI: The AI was enhanced to interact with the terrain and player actions, making races more competitive and engaging.
- User Interface: The game includes a HUD that displays statistics such as current speed and lap progress, as well as a minimap for better navigtion.
- Sound and Visual Effects: Adding immersive sound and visual effects helped create a more realistic racing environment.

To improve the game, I would have liked to introduce a damage model for the cars, which would add a layer of reallism and require players to drive more cautiously. Furthernore, I could expand the tracks to allow more room for maneuvering which would enhance the racing dynamics.

Overall,although the inital concept was simpler, the final game presents a much more rewarding experience. The challanges that came with it pushed me to learn and app;y new skills, therefore, broadening my understanding of game development.

Here are the points I implemented:
-  The circuit must be located totally or partially on mountainous terrain, and may also include urban parts.
- Place different shortcuts throughout the circuit.
- Create different circuits for the player to choose from.
- Create different cars for the player to choose from with different configurations.
- You must have a menu with which to select between the different circuits and cars.
- The race will consist of 3 laps, and will only finish after the 3rd lap (The video demo only did 2 for the sake of time) . 
- Add a HUD where the player can see the current speed, lap number, or other details.
- Add sound or FX
