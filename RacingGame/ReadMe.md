This is the Racing Game I've been working on through the workshops. It has features such as AI, Speedometer, and a mini map. The points I implemented are: The circuit must be located totally or partially on mountainous terrain, and may also include urban parts (10 points).
Place different shortcuts throughout the circuit (10 points).
Create different circuits for the player to choose from (10 points).
Create different cars for the player to choose from with different configurations (10 points).
You must have a menu with which to select between the different circuits and cars (20 points).
The race will consist of 3 laps, and will only finish after the 3rd lap (The video demo only did 2 for the sake of time) (20points).
Add a HUD where the player can see the current speed, lap number, or other details (10 points)
Add sound or FX (10 points). It isn't finished as I'd like to add more circuits, more AI, and change the lookout of the game. I also want to add damage to the cars as well as a replay of the race.
I used youtube videos to help me throughout the development of the game:
