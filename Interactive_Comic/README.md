Project Name:

Time Catastrophe


Project Description:

For this assignment, we were asked to make a 6-panel interactive comic that tells a story on a webpage. After discussion within the group, we concluded that we were going to create a sci-fi time travel story called Time Catastrophe in which a scientist accidentally activates his machine and has to work his way back to the present. Through sound, images (done by Photoshop and Illustrator), and user interactivity we aimed to create an immersive experience that could engage users. Once we finalized our idea we began splitting the work.


Process:

In the initial three panels, the primary objective was to provide contextualization within the comic, primarily aimed at introducing and progressively developing the narrative towards its climax. Commencing with the first panel, the visual depiction portrays the scientist engrossed in the operation of the time machine within his laboratory. Notably, an interactive element is incorporated in this panel, allowing the reader to engage by activating a clickable button, which triggers a malfunction in the time machine, resulting in the inadvertent transportation of the scientist. Subsequently, the second panel exhibits the scientist traversing through a wormhole, leading to his arrival in the prehistoric epoch, specifically the Jurassic era, as depicted in the third panel. The scientist admires the creatures and then attempts to travel back to his lab. The composite imagery present in the first three panels were made using Photoshop.
Similar to Panel 1-3, Panel 4-6 also uses Photoshop and Illustrator. After the attempt to return back to his lab, the scientist ends up in medieval times (fourth panel) where he arrives in the midst of the battle. This is the main conflict of the story; the scientist does not know how to get back. A text is popped up followed by an interactive clickable button to take part in the battle and return to his present time. However, he ends up in the 19th century (fifth panel) where he encounters a boy giving out newspapers. He soon realizes that he needs to know the year he is in to return back to the present time. Thus, he interacts with the child to figure out the year and returns back to the present (sixth panel).

In the coding process, the endeavor to attain seamless animations posed a noteworthy challenge. Additionally, the smooth transitions between individual animation sequences and the inter-panel transitions necessitated careful attention and deliberation.


Reflection/Evaluation:

The project provided us with an opportunity to showcase our aptitude for creative storytelling by incorporating interactive elements that enhance user engagement. By skillfully combining visually captivating elements, immersive sound, and interactive features, our aim was to create a memorable and captivating experience for readers. Overcoming the challenges associated with animation timing and transitions required careful execution, resulting in a final product that effectively conveyed the intended narrative and delivered an enjoyable user experience.
