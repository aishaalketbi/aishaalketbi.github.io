Project Name: Hunt For Water

Project Description: For this assignment, we aimed to create an engaging video that allows the viewer to follow the journey of the young man in desperate need of water creating a comedic and empathetic experience. After looking at the assignment prompt we decided to take inspiration from option 4 which was to ‘tell a story that mixes video shot at different locations into a cohesive whole’. The overall concept of the video revolves around the theme of adversity and obstacles. The man's basic need (his thirst) and the lack of water resemble the obstacle. This was then followed by adversity and misfortune as the man didn’t have water in his dorm and was encountered by various people. As mentioned earlier, we wanted to create a sense of empathy for the viewers through the hurdles he had to face which overall may have created a feeling of frustration and perhaps humor. 

Process: Once the team had chosen the idea for the video piece, we created a script that outlined the sequence of events and planned the shots that would help communicate the message of the video. We then started recording the footage while making revisions to the script as needed. We used the Blackmagic camera and H5 Zoom recorder to implement this concept. We took establishing, medium, and close-up shots to highlight the different emotions the character was feeling. Furthermore, we used the H5 Zoom recorder to capture nature sounds, sound effects, and dialogue.
The recordings underwent post-production editing in Adobe Premiere Pro, where the audio tracks were simultaneously overlaid during the process. During the video editing phase, certain adjustments were made to enhance the quality of the footage. Specifically, the intensity, brightness, shadows, and lighting of some segments were appropriately modified to improve clarity, compensating for suboptimal lighting conditions during the initial filming. To address variations in audio loudness resulting from the distance between the subject of interest and the microphone, positive normalization was applied to certain audio tracks, while negative normalization was applied to others. We then carefully arranged the audio tracks to ensure that the speech and actions were synchronized without any delays. In addition, captions were included in the video to help the audience understand and follow the dialogues that were spoken throughout the piece. The team designed a cinematic introduction for the film in Adobe After Effects following tutorials from YouTube and templates from www.enzeefx.com. 
 After this, we created an interactive website to display the video. The website displays a water video background and the color blue indicating what the movie is about and perhaps triggering thirst in the user. There are different interactions the users can engage with. This includes the navigation bar where the user can easily go to different sections of the website. Within the navigation bar, there is also an empty cup on the left-hand side which fills up with water as you scroll resembling the character's journey in the movie. There is also a gallery in which the user can click through different photos captured from filming the movie.

 Reflection/Evaluation: 
Upon careful evaluation of the entire project, the team identified several alternative actions that could have led to improved outcomes. Notably, one major challenge encountered was the inadequate lighting conditions during certain shots, which posed difficulties in post-production recovery. Due to the team's limited experience in cinematography, efforts to rectify the lighting issues were unsuccessful, ultimately impacting the overall video quality. To address this in the future, it would be advantageous for the team to dedicate time to comprehend the technical aspects of the BlackMagic Pocket Camera and experiment with diverse lighting conditions, thereby enhancing their ability to handle challenging lighting situations.

Furthermore, the video editing process presented considerable difficulties due to the team's unfamiliarity with the editing software. Compounding this issue was the manner in which certain scenes were captured, exacerbating the challenges during editing. Specifically, consecutive shots were taken using different lenses, such as a 7-14mm lens followed by a 12-35mm lens. This resulted in jarring and abrupt transitions between frames, posing significant challenges for corrective measures during the editing phase. Consequently, the team has recognized the importance of carefully attending to shot descriptions during the scripting process, particularly for consecutive shots, as even slight miscalculations can incur substantial time costs during post-production.
Overall, our initial concepts were achieved. We achieved the goal of transporting the users into this suspenseful and comedic short film through the use of videography and editing. The deliberate shots and inner dialogue script helped to convey the message through the screen. However, we were met with difficulties such as no sound being recorded for this first half. As we were short on time, we had to use both the camera audio and the Zoom recorder audio to overcome this.
